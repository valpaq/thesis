The computation of multiple points remains a cornerstone task in the realm of public-key cryptography. The incorporation of complex multiplication in elliptic curves, once primarily of theoretical interest, has gained significant traction in recent years. This paper delves into an investigation of the operational efficiency in executing multiple point computations through complex multiplication, employing Python and Sage as the programming tools.
